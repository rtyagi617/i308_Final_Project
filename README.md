# i308_Final_Project
Your team Final Project task is to finish your final project by turning in a web-based interface for your queries as well as the final version of the documents you created in the various project steps.

During the course your team of 3-4 students will work together to create a complete database system for an imaginary small business or organization. In the six modules of the course you will complete the following steps:

Gather and refine specifications for the system.

Create a conceptual design for your system by creating an Entity-relationship Diagram (ERD)

Convert your ERD into a logical model consisting of a set of table structures.

Construct and populate these table structures in MySQL.

Write a set of queries to extract the relevant information from your tables.

Build a web interface for your system using PHP and HTML.

In each module you will complete one of these steps. They must be completed satisfactorily before your team can proceed to the next module. In the final week of the course, you will turn in and be graded on your complete project.
